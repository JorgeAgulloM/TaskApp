    Version 1.0.0 - 02/08/2022

        This app tries to list a series of tasks that the user can create and, edit and delete, also 
    you can mark them as completed, or unmark it, see a list of the last completed tasks and a history 
    of them.
        For now and for this version only the list will be saved in local mode. 
    The user will be able to apply the typical light/dark modes. 

    This app is developed with Andorid Jetpack Compose, with Google's Material You (Material 3).
